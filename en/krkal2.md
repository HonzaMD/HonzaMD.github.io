Krkal is an excellent logical-action game. With one of three different 
characters, you have to avoid all dangerous traps, deal with various 
items, escape from deadly monsters and in the first place – boil your 
brain – to finally find the way through and reach so long desired exit... 
and then? Just select level that is even more difficult and rush to 
the battle again.

The levels are built of many miscellaneous items, which interact one with 
the other. You will push stones, slide on the ice, avoid stepping on 
mines, play with the switches, wander in complex labyrinths and even 
set up the traffic signs to take advantage of the traffic monsters!

Simply, Krkal is very interesting and unique. You observe everything 
from above and will miss neither a professional graphics nor stylish 
music. With KRKAL, you will not only be able to build new levels from 
existing items, but also create quite new objects. You will be able to 
improve and modify the game itself!
