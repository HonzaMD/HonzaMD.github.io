You can pick up some items and collect them in your inventory. You may 
collect up to 12 items of each type. Most of these items are picked up 
automatically as you step on the cell they are located. You cannot decide 
whether to pick up such item or not. The traffic signs are exception, you 
can choose to pick a sign by pressing ‘A’ key. Once picked up, the items 
cannot be discarded, but you can use some of them (as described above). 
Some items are used automatically – for instance, the key is used after 
you have tried to step on the cell blocked by the lock. Here we would 
like to warn of one captious feature: If you have a key and you are forced 
to move towards the lock (usually on the ice), you will unlock it when 
either you want or not.
