A player character can collect certain items. A maximum of 12 pieces
of each item is allowed. Most items get picked up automatically, as soon
as the character enters the cell. With these items it is not possible to
decide whether you want them or not. An exception are signs, they are
collected using a special key 'A'.

The collected items cannot be disposed of without a reason. Some items
can be used with a special key (see above). Other items are used
automatically - e.g. key is used always, when a player wants to enter
a cell which a lock. Here I want to point out one sneaky thing - if
a player has a key and some force makes him enter (e.g. sliding on ice)
a cell with the lock - then the lock will always unlock, whether the player
wishes it or not.
